This is a minimal starter exmple single page js app, to demonstrate
the features of <a href="https://github.com/progrium/hotweb">HotWeb</a>

This example is using <a href="https://mithril.js.org/">mithril</a>
as it is fast, small and provides routing and XHR. (with React/Vue you need extra dependencies)

Also css is kept as a single main.css file. But you can add your favourite framework (<a href="https://bulma.io/">bulma</a> or <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">tailwind</a>)
## Usage

start webserver on port 8080:
```
make dev
```

which is equivalent with:
```
hotweb
```

Note: it will open up the default browser
